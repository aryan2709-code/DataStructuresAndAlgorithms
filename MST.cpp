/*
A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subgraph of a connected, undirected, weighted graph that:

âœ… Satisfies the following:
Spans all the vertices (i.e., includes every node).

Uses exactly n - 1 edges, where n is the number of vertices.

Forms no cycles (it's a tree).

Minimizes the total edge weight among all possible spanning trees.

/* Prims Algorithm can be used to find out the mst*/
