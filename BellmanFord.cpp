/*
Bellman-Ford algorithm is another technique for finding the shortest path in a directed graph.
It is a single source shortest path algorithm
If the graph is undirected, we treat each edge as two directed edges:
For example, an edge like 1 --- 5 will be represented as both 1 -> 5 and 5 -> 1.

For a graph with 'n' nodes, we perform 'n - 1' iterations of edge relaxation.
Why n - 1 iterations? â€” Because, in the worst case, the shortest path from the source to any other node can have at most n - 1 edges.

To detect a negative weight cycle, we perform one extra (i.e., the nth) iteration.
If during this iteration, any distance still gets updated, then the graph contains a negative weight cycle.
